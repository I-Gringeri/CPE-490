HW assignment 1
CPE 490 : Socket Programming in C
Prof. James Du
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate
with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other
socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener
socket while the client reaches out to the server.

HW: You need to create two nodes (two C/Python files), one for client and one for server. The client
and the server can set up a connection and communicate with each other.
